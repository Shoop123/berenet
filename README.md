Matrix based neural network library.

> This is a library I threw together while learning about neural networks. So far it creates and trains (with backpropogation)
a regular ANN with a few tuning knobs available to cutomize training. Those will be covered further down.
<hr>
This library used the matrix functionality provided by numpy. If you do not have it install follow this link and get it:
https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html
or just run "pip install numpy" in terminal (only tested in Ubuntu).
